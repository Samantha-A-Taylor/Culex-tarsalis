# Local Adaptation and Range Exanpansion in Culex Mosquitoes
## Introduction
*Culex tarsalis* (also known as the Western Encephalitis Mosquito) is a North American mosquito species known for being the principle vector of the West Nile virus along with other arboviruses. This mosquito primarily inhabits the western U.S. and comprises of three genetically distinct genetic population clusters: the Pacific, Sonoran, and Midwest clusters.
## Motivation
Due to *C. tarsalis* mosquitoes carrying dangerous diseases that infect both birds and livestock animals, questions arise portaning to the possibility of them continuing to spread east of the Mississippi. Therefore, for this project, we will be examining:
  * What environmental factors drive local adaptation and genetic divergence in different populations of *Culex*?
  * Can we predict the spread of *Culex* in the near future to better inform management practices to mitigate disease risks?
